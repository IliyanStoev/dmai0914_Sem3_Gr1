Business Process Management (BPM) is the set of concepts, methods, and tools that help organizations define, implement, measure and improve their end-to-end processes. 
This module introduces a process-oriented view of the flows of materials, information, products and services through and across organizational functions. All organizations must carefully analyze and document their business processes and must continuously assess the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes to minimize cost and maximize value creation. 
This module helps students identify information-bearing events, assess and improve process efficiency, learn to model and analyze business processes, and understand the interactions between human behavior and process design.

146069 : Engineering Economy
This module aims to provide the student with an introduction to economic decision making. This covers the basics of economic analysis from an engineering perspective, dealing with the principles and methods for analyzing the economic feasibility of alternatives and for making selection decisions among them.
The student will learn how to perform economic evaluation and develop cost models for problem solving. Concepts in this class are equally applicable to engineering, business and financial systems problems.
Assessment is through a final examination, plus several homework & quizzes given during the semester.

3rd year 
146078 : Mobile Programming - Y
This module introduces the programming technologies and design approaches for mobile computing systems. Students study relevant applications to understand them better. This module gives students a chance to construct their own application on a widely-used mobile platform.


146077 : Data Mining
This module aims to provide students with the theoretical and practical knowledge and skills to collect, modify, and analyse a large amount of data from various sources. Topics covered in this module include basic unsupervised/supervised learning algorithms, novelty detection algorithms, clustering methods, and association rules such as k-nearest neighbour, Nae Bayesian classifier, decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines, K-Means clustering, and A-priori rules. This module comprises lectures and programming exercises with R language to develop the practical skills of data mining. The students are assessed by one quiz in the middle of the semester, the final-exam at the end of the semester, and a set of (2~4) R programming assignments during the course.

146076 : Operations Management
This module provides the student with the ability to develop understanding of the concepts, processes and approaches for the operations and supply chain management and strategies in various service and operations in business information systems 
The student will learn a fundamental concepts of the competitive operations strategy, the management of change, project management, product design, quality management, designing & managing processes and supply chains, and how to apply some quantitative methods of analysis to support decision-making in the various operations & service management activities which are important areas connected strongly with ITM.
Assessment is through the midterm exam, final exam, and quiz, plus a group assignment and a book
